# Vroom Vroom: Inheriting Objects

- Create a constructor function called `Car` that takes two arguments: `make` and `model`. Add a method to the Car prototype called `getMakeModel()` that returns the make and model of the car in a string.
- Create a constructor function called `SportsCar` that takes three arguments: `make`, `model`, and `topSpeed`. Inherit the Car prototype in the SportsCar prototype, and add a method to the SportsCar prototype called `getTopSpeed()` that returns the top speed of the sports car.
